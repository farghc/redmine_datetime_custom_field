Redmine DateTime Custom Field Plugin
======================

This plugin adds DateTime Type to standard custom fields.

* This is a fork of https://github.com/Smile-SA/redmine_datetime_custom_field
which is based on
* Nanego's plugin : https://github.com/nanego/redmine_datetime_custom_field

Just added some small changes to make the plugin work with Redmine 5
